Hi there, I'm Kerwin Wang, I am currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in Electronic Science and Technology at Xidian University, under the supervision of Prof. Cheng Deng. I received my B.E. degree from the same university in 2021. My research explores the adaptive capabilities of AI, specifically focusing on Incremental Learning, Few-shot Learning, and Model Editing within Computer Vision and Machine Learning. I am passionate about solving complex challenges in these fields, and my research has been published at international conferences such as AAAI, CVPR and NeurIPS.

Beyond the lab, I am a huge fan of movies and music. I have a strong curiosity for all things new and enjoy connecting with people from diverse backgrounds. You can also get to know me better through my public social media profiles. Whether you are interested in my research or just want to say hi, please feel free to reach out!
